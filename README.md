# Solvers
Puzzles are a very ... interesting entertainment.<br/>I made them when I was bored and curious about my puzzles abilities.
The algorithm I used is backtracing with additional techniques in each solver.

They're not perfect, but pretty good at easy and medium puzzles, and decent at hard ones (mainly tested on [Logi](https://lamiglowki.net/) puzzles). In the future, after learning about new algorithms and optimization techniques, I'm planning to refresh them all by optimizing and add new ones :].
